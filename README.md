# 🌱 SMART IRRIGATION SYSTEM

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Smart Irrigation System** is a machine learning-based project designed to optimize water usage in agriculture.  
It predicts the water requirements of crops based on environmental conditions such as **temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and rainfall**.  
This helps farmers save water, improve crop yields, and move towards sustainable agriculture.

## 📊 Model Details

* Uses **supervised machine learning algorithms** for prediction.
* Trained on environmental and crop-related data.
* Outputs whether irrigation is required and the estimated water level.

---

## 🌍 Applications

* Efficient **water management** in agriculture.
* **Cost reduction** for farmers.
* Supports **sustainable farming practices**.

---

## 📎 Future Improvements
